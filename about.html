                        <h1>I'm Paulina</h1>
                        <p>My name is Paulina and I am a Polish in the midst of a never-ending love affair with world
                            travel. With a passion for exploring the planet and photography.</p>

                        <p>I was born and raised in Poland but currently I live in the beautiful, sunny island - Malta.
                            I started travelling at the age of 25 and in just 6 short years I have travelled across over
                            12 countries and two continents, but the more I see, the more I crave!</p>

                        <p>After graduating from univeristy and ‘selling my soul’ as a corporate slave I started to feel
                            like I was wasting the best years of my life behind a desk working for someone else’s
                            passions and dreams. There had to be more to life than this!</p>

                        <p>Still, most of the time it’s easier to carry on with the routine of the daily grind, always
                            dreaming that ‘one day’ you will take that trip, than that take that leap and leave your
                            comfort zone.</p>

                        <p>The turning point for me was when I was told I had to have an operation on my eye. It was the
                            jolt I needed to realise that life is far too short to put off things off, or not make the
                            most of every day, even in your twenties you are never too young to get sick.</p>

                        <p>So after the operation I made up my mind to take control of my life, to live it the way I
                            wanted not the way that society thought that I should.</p>

                        <p>I decided to follow my dreams, travel and do what I love to do. Last year I moved to Malta
                            and this was one of the best decisions in my life.
                            I still work in a corporation but having a goal in my mind that one day I will quit and will
                            have a 100% remote job and see all the beauty of our world!</p>

                        <p>The things in the world that I love most include italian food, Thailand, the sea, sunsets,
                            nature, photography, street food, pistacchios, coconut, not getting sunburnt and being on
                            the road.</p>

                        <p>I believe that travel is so much more than simply seeing the sights – that travel, and the
                            things you learn from it, can really change your life.</p>

                        <p>I travel to grow as a person, to meet others who inspire and educate me, to have my life
                            enriched by the beauty and diversity of this amazing world and to have my eyes, mind and
                            heart opened wide.</p>

                        <p>But most of all I travel for freedom – to live life on my terms, to be in charge of my own
                            destiny, to give myself the biggest luxury – Time. Time to pursue my passions, dreams and
                            ambitions.</p>
